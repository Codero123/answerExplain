This is because the equation 8 / 2 (2 + 2) can be simplified using order of operations (BIDMAS OR PEMDAS) to 8 / 2 * 4 The times is there because in algebra when two variables of different sorts (number and bracket in this case) are touching, they are multiplied. This can be further simplified to 4 * 4 as when we only have multiplication and division, we go left to right, so the answer is 4 * 4 (16)!
